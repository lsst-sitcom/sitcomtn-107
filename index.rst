M1M3 actuator delays and following errors
#########################################

Abstract
========

.. abstract::

   This study looks at the delays between the actuator commanded forces and the measured forces.  For bump tests and "gentle" slews, the measured forces match the applied forces well, with a delay on the order of 100ms.  However, for more aggressive slews, the measured forces do not track the applied forces well at all, indicating that the problem with large hardpoint forces for the aggressive slews is more serious than just time delays.
